# UMKC-MCOM Framework

## Goals

- Establish a design system for UMKC.edu
- Modernize and Optimize UMKC.edu code base
- Improve the CMS user experience

## Standards

- Scalable design
- Higher accessibility standards
- Easy to maintain

## Design

- How do we decide what stays and what changes?
  - What is most used by web editors?
  - What is not used by web editors?
- Page template options? Do we standardize page options?
  - About page
  - Academics
  - Events Page
  - etc.
- Design gaps - what's missing from landing and/or standard layouts? What standards are needed for each new type of page(s)?
- How to evolve design while limiting drastic changes to the design?
  - Design should be evolved; but not wanting to trigger additional rounds of approval.
- How can we improve a11y?
  - Focus States, ARIA use, etc.
- What are the container sizes and breakpoints?
- Document, educate and share design philosophy
- Set max word counts, limits and truncation points
- Header redesign and how rows interact
- Content Review: What are the things our website needs to do
  - User Journey drafts
- Integrate external tools into the design system
- Standardize designs
  - Headings, style guides, etc.
- Photo sizes - standardize

## Development
